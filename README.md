# Trapper-Keeper

Trapper-Keeper simulates Google's Keep application. In this application a user has the ability to add multiple cards to the DOM that contain both a title and n list items. Once added, the cards provide an intuitive note-keeping feature that are stored on a server and persist between page loads. A user can both edit and delete existing cards as well as add new cards with a few simple clicks.

## Screenshot

The original design of the application was modeled after [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) itself, but additional styles were added to differentiate from it at the end.
